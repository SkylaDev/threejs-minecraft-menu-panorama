Just a proof of concept for rendering a Minecraft menu panorama in a website using [threejs](https://threejs.org/)!

Doesnt require altering original Minecraft panorama image sets, just drag and drop into the images folder and you are good to go!

#### Feel free to use this if ya want I dont mind lol
